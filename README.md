# Description:
This Python script requests and fetches random user data from the API Ninjas service. The code demonstrates how to use the Requests library to access data from the API, and it includes an API key for authorization. You can use this as a starting point for incorporating random user data into your projects or applications. This project was an experiement to test a REST API that generates a random user with distinct fields upon each call. It is built based on Python.
